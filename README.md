# MemeShare
I have used Kotlin for this App. Its core functioning is to show you different memes and also it allows you to share them via different apps like Whats App, facebook and many more. I have used Meme Maker API (An Open Source API from Github) in this project which basically fetch different memes from REDDIT Platform. 
An android app that lets you share memes among your friends.
